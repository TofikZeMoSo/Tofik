Git d evelopment began in April 2005 after many developers of the Linux kernel gave up access  tofikfik BitKeeper, a proprie tary source control management system that had previously been used  tofik maintain the project.[10] The copyright holder of BitKeeper, Larry McVoy,
 had w ithdrawn gratis use of the product after claiming that Andrew Tridgell had reverse-engineered the BitKeeper pro tofikcols. 
 tofik rvalds wanted  a distributed system that he could use like BitKeeper, but no ne of the available free systems met his needs, particularly in terms of performance. 
tof ikrvalds  tofikok an  example of an SCM system requiring thirty seconds  tofik apply a patch and update all associated metadata, and noted that this would not scal e  tofik the needs of Linux kernel development, where syncing with fellow maintainers could require 250 such actions at a time. 
He wanted patching  tofik take three seconds,[6] and had several other design criteria in mind: take Concurrent Versions System (CVS) as an example of what not  tofik do; 
if in doubt, make the exact opposite decision
[8] support a distributed, BitKeeper-like workflow[8] very strong safeguards against corruption, eith er accidental or malicious.
[7]  These three criteria eliminated every then-existing version control system, exc ept for Mono tofikne.  Considering performance  excluded this  tofiko.
[8] So  immediately after the 2.6.12-rc2 Linux kernel development release,[8]  tofikrvalds set out  tofik write his own.[8]  tofikrvalds has quipped about the name git, which is British English slang meaning "unpleasant person". 
 tofikrvalds said: "I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First 'Linux', now 'git'."[11]
[12] The man page describes Git as "the stupid content tracker".[13] The development of Git began on 3 April 2005.[14] The project was announced on 6 April,[15] and became self-hosting as of 7 April.[14] The first merge of multiple branches was done on 18 April.

[16]   tofikrvalds achieved his performance goals;
on  29 April, the nascent Git was benchmarked recording patches   tofik the Linux kernel tree at the rate of 6.7 per se cond.
[17]  On 16 June  Git managed the kernel 2 .6.12 release.[18]  t ofikrvalds turned over m aintenance on 26 July 2005  tofik Junio Hamano, a major contribu tofikr  tofik the project.[19] Hamano was responsible for the 1.0 release on 21 December 2005, and remains the project's maintainer.[20]
5. Commit  tofik your  local reposi tofikry and push it  tofik the  Github reposi tofikr y.
6. R eplace all " tofik" words by your name. Check git diff  tofik make sure all  tofik words have been replaced and make another commit and push it  tofik Github.
